<p>The processing steps performed in the uploaded R script are summarised below. The code itself is also reasonably well commented.</p>

<h2>
<a name="1-loading-data" class="anchor" href="#1-loading-data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1) Loading data</h2>

<h2>
<a name="2-pre-processing" class="anchor" href="#2-pre-processing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2) Pre-Processing</h2>

<p>Only data columns (attributes) which provide some differentiation in the final test data-set are kept.
This could be considered 'cheating' as the final test data is examined; however it is reasonable to assume that in most applications where a prediction is necessary which attributes will be gathered going forwards would be known.</p>

<p>All of the attributes in the final test set are converted to factors; and those with fewer than 2 factors (so no differentiation between any of the samples) are dropped from the data. It was also necessary to drop the row number variable 'X'; as otherwise this will lead to the prediction of all A's in the testing data (as the row numbers are all small).</p>

<h2>
<a name="3-data-splitting" class="anchor" href="#3-data-splitting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3) Data Splitting</h2>

<p>The training data is split into 3 sets, with 70% of the observations used for model training, 20% used for cross-validation and any required model tuning work, and 10% used for making a final estimation of the model accuracy.</p>

<h2>
<a name="4-model-training" class="anchor" href="#4-model-training"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4) Model Training</h2>

<p>The model is then trained using the random forest method (method='rf') from within the caret package. All of the default values are used; as an initial attempt, and all attributes (i.e. all data columns other than the class) were included as predictors.
This training step takes rather a long time to run, because of the large number of attributes which have been kept.</p>

<h2>
<a name="5-checking-accuracy" class="anchor" href="#5-checking-accuracy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5) Checking Accuracy</h2>

<p>The accuracy of the model was then checked against the training and cross-validation sets. These both gave a very low miss-classification error. The confusion matrices are reproduced below for reference:</p>

<hr><p>Given how low the miss-classification error was it was decided that no further model tuning was required, so all that was left is to make an estimate of the out of sample error.
This is done by attempting to predict the class of the test instances. The confusion matrix for the test set is given below. This would suggest the out-of-sample accuracy of 0.9985, which should be sufficient to correctly classify the 20 example cases.</p>

<hr><p>Because no modifications were made to the base random forest method, it is likely that a slightly better model could be made by running the training method again on all of the data; but it would not then be possible to quote an expected out of sample accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally predictions are made regarding the actual test set (for which the actual classification is not known).
The predicted classes are (in order):
